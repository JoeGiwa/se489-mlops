## 2. Project Overview
Summary:
  This project aims to build an automated music genre classification pipeline using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system classifies audio tracks into one of ten genres from the GTZAN dataset.

Problem Statement & Motivation:
  With the exponential rise of digital music, manual organization of music libraries is inefficient. Automating genre classification enhances user experience and recommendation systems in platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.

Main Objectives:
  - Extract and analyze audio features using Librosa
  - Train and evaluate both traditional ML and deep learning models (DNN, CNN)
  - Incorporate MLOps best practices (DVC, Hydra, code linting, reproducibility)
  - Compare model performance and explore deployment options
